- **Title**: Task Management Core Operations
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Draft
- **Lines**: 723 lines
- **Size**: 23 KB

**Content Coverage**:
- Overview and user story
- Functional specifications (Inputs, Processing, Outputs)
- 6 Business Rules (BR-TSK-001 through BR-TSK-006)
- 12 Acceptance Criteria scenarios (AC-TSK-001-01 through AC-TSK-001-12)
- Non-functional requirements (Performance, Usability, Data Integrity, Accessibility, Security)

**Key Features Documented**:
1. Task Creation (CRUD - Create)
2. Task Update (CRUD - Update)
3. Task Deletion with confirmation (CRUD - Delete)
4. Task Status Toggle (active/completed)
5. Task List Query and Display (CRUD - Read)

**Data Model Defined**:
```python
class Task:
    id: str  # UUID
    title: str  # 1-200 characters
    description: str  # Optional, max 1000 characters
    created_date: datetime
    due_date: datetime | None  # Optional
    status: str  # "active" | "completed"
    priority: str  # "low" | "medium" | "high"
```

**Business Rules Defined**:
- BR-TSK-001: Task title is mandatory (1-200 characters)
- BR-TSK-002: Due date must be present or future
- BR-TSK-003: Task ID is system-generated (UUID)
- BR-TSK-004: Delete requires confirmation
- BR-TSK-005: Task status toggle is instant
- BR-TSK-006: Default values for optional fields

**Acceptance Criteria Scenarios**:
1. Create task with complete data (happy path)
2. Create task with minimal data (title only)
3. Validation error - empty title
4. Validation error - title too long
5. Validation error - past due date
6. Update task - modify title and priority
7. Delete task with confirmation (accept)
8. Cancel delete operation
9. Toggle task status - active to completed
10. Toggle task status - completed to active
11. Display task list with mixed tasks
12. Display empty state

## Process Followed

### Stage 1: Document Analysis
- Analyzed user-provided specification
- Identified core features and requirements
- Extracted data model structure
- Identified business rules and constraints

### Stage 2: Structure Planning
- Selected FR document template (based on FR-GUI-001 example)
- Organized requirements into standard sections
- Planned acceptance criteria scenarios
- Identified edge cases and validation rules

### Stage 3: Document Generation
- Generated FR-TSK-001 with comprehensive coverage
- Applied standard document ID format (FR-TSK-001)
- Generated UUID for document tracking
- Followed modular structure (modules/task_manager/current/requirements/)

### Stage 4: Quality Assurance
- Verified document structure matches template
- Ensured all sections are complete
- Validated acceptance criteria are testable
- Confirmed business rules are clear and enforceable

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements

**Core CRUD Operations**:
- Create: Users can create tasks with title, description, due date, priority
- Read: Users can view all tasks in a list
- Update: Users can modify existing task properties
- Delete: Users can delete tasks with confirmation

**Task Properties**:
- ID: System-generated UUID (immutable)
- Title: Required, 1-200 characters
- Description: Optional, max 1000 characters
- Created Date: Auto-generated timestamp
- Due Date: Optional, must be present or future
- Status: "active" or "completed"
- Priority: "low", "medium", or "high"

**User Interactions**:
- "New Task" button opens creation dialog
- Checkbox toggles task completion status
- Edit button opens task modification dialog
- Delete button triggers confirmation dialog
- Task list displays all tasks with filters

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**:
- Task creation: < 500ms
- List rendering (1000 tasks): < 1 second
- Toggle response: < 100ms
- Delete operation: < 300ms

**Usability**:
- Modal dialogs for task creation/editing
- Keyboard shortcuts support
- Immediate visual feedback
- Clear, actionable error messages

**Data Integrity**:
- Data persists across restarts
- Atomic operations (all or nothing)
- Input validation before persistence
- Error recovery without data corruption

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create AC-TSK-001 Test Plan** (if not already created)
   - Detailed test scenarios for all 12 acceptance criteria
   - Edge cases and error handling tests
   - Test data and verification steps

2. **Run Design Agent** (`/full --module task_manager`)
   - Generate system architecture
   - Design class diagrams
   - Create API specifications (if applicable)
   - Design database schema

3. **Run Testing Agent**
   - Generate unit tests (70% coverage target)
   - Generate integration tests (20% coverage)
   - Generate E2E tests (10% coverage)

4. **Run Implementation Agent**
   - Implement domain entities (Task class)
   - Implement application services (CRUD operations)
   - Implement UI components
   - Implement data persistence layer

5. **Run Verification Agent**
   - Generate traceability matrix (FR → Code → Tests)
   - Identify coverage gaps
   - Produce verification report

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- FR-TSK-002: Task filtering and sorting
- FR-TSK-003: Task categories/tags
- FR-TSK-004: Task search functionality
- FR-TSK-005: Task notifications and reminders
- FR-TSK-006: Task recurrence (recurring tasks)

## Traceability

### Source Specification
- **Source**: User-provided specification (inline in request)
- **Extracted Features**:
  - Core CRUD operations
